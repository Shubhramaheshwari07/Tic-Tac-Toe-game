**Project Overview:**
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python and the Tkinter library. The game allows two players, X and O, to play against each other on a 3x3 grid.

**Game Features:**
-A 3x3 grid for playing the game.
-Two players, X and O, can play against each other.
-The game checks for a winner after each move.
-The game can be reset for a new round.
-A winner line is drawn to highlight the winning combination.

**How to Play:**
-Run the game by executing the Python script.
-The game window will appear with a 3x3 grid and a "Restart Game" button.
-Player X makes the first move by clicking on an empty cell.
-Player O makes their move by clicking on an empty cell.
-The game checks for a winner after each move.
-If a player wins, a winner line is drawn and a message box appears to announce the winner.
-If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.
-Click the "Restart Game" button to start a new round.

**How to Run the Game:**
To run the game, simply execute the tic_tac_toe.py file using Python.
**python tic_tac_toe.py** .
This will start a new game, and you can play by clicking on the squares to place your mark (X or O).

**Code Structure:**
The code is organized into a single Python file, tic_tac_toe.py. The file contains a TicTacToe class that encapsulates the game logic. The class has several methods for creating the game grid, handling button clicks, checking for a winner, and drawing the winner line.

**Dependencies:**
-Python 3.x .
-Tkinter library (included with Python).
